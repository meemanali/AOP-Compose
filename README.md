Android AOP Module

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows separation of cross-cutting
concerns—such as logging, tracing, analytics, or instrumentation—from core business logic. Instead
of duplicating such logic across multiple classes or methods, AOP applies it declaratively using
annotations and aspects.
